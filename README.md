# Future Improvements


1) Update the application IP addresses by settip up Google cloud or Amazon Ec2 instance to make it available online to all.Currently this project could be set up locally on the localhost as i ran out of free tiers in amazon and google cloud accounts. 

2) Later making a android application apk file to see the application in the phone as well

### Setting up the Project

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krishnakaushik25/DL-models-medical.git
   ```
2. Install pip(python) packages
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Now wait for all the packages to get installed. Once this step is done, we need to run our application
    ```py
   python core_app.py
   ```
